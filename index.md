This site contains a series of lessons to each non-computing people about 
machine learning (ML). The lessons are all in Jupyter Notebook form, and 
are intended to run in Google's Colaboratory environment. Working through 
these lessons will not make you an expert in the field, but will give you 
enough of an introduction to get started with your own projects. 

The current lessons are:

1. School attendance rates regression
2. Iris classification
3. Breast cancer tumor classification

New content will be added periodically, and each new addition will be 
accompanied by a new blog post.
