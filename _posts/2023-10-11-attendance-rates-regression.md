Our first lesson is a regression problem, where we try to predict the attendance rate for a school, based on a variety of input variables. The data we use here is open data from the public school districts in Connecticut, obtained from the [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-attendance-by-student-group-and-district-2022-2023) stie. 


Like all of the lessons in the workshop, the instruction and the Python code for the lesson are all contained in a single [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) Jupyter notebook. In order to use these lessons, you will need a Google account.
