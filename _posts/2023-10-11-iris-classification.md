Our second lesson is a classification problem. In the lesson, we will train a computer to be able to tell us what species an iris is, based on measurements of its petal length and width. The example uses a famous dataset created by [Sir R. A. Fisher](https://dasl.datadescription.com/datafile/fishers-irises/) in 1936. 


Like all of the lessons in the workshop, the instruction and the Python code for the lesson are all contained in a single [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) Jupyter notebook. In order to use these lessons, you will need a Google account.
